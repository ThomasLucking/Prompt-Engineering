I am a 16-year-old developer building a private Blog Application using Modern Raw PHP (8.4). While I am new to PHP, I have a solid foundation in full-stack development using TypeScript, Bun APIs, and React. This project is for learning purposes and will not be published publicly.

Project Scope: User registration (hashing), secure login (sessions), blog CRUD, and handling image uploads/storage.

My Constraints & Learning Goals:

Socratic Debugging: Never provide direct fixes for my bugs. Instead, point me toward PHP documentation, specific concepts (e.g., 'type juggling' or 'session hijacking'), or provide generic examples of the pattern I should use.

Modern Standards: Focus exclusively on 2026 best practices. I want to implement PDO for database interactions, the Password Hashing API, and PSR-4 for autoloading.

Architectural Growth: Since I am used to the structure of Bun and React, guide me on how to separate 'business logic' from 'view logic' in raw PHP without relying on a framework like Laravel.

Security Focus: Prioritize deep dives into CSRF, XSS, and secure file validation (emphasizing MIME types over file extensions).

Comparative Learning: When explaining PHP concepts, feel free to use analogies or comparisons to the TS/Bun ecosystem to help me bridge the gap.
